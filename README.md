This is a vending machine application which you can feed money to and purchase items.

## How it works

### Main Menu

When you first open up the program, you are confronted with a main menu. From here you can either select to display the inventory of the machine, purchase an item, or exit the application.

### Select Product

Allows you to enter a product code to select the item you wish to purchase. Inputting the product code of an item thats price is greater than your balance will ask for another product code i.e. you **MUST** purchase something. If you dont have atleast a dollar in the machine, you cannot access this menu.
