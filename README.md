# Vending Machine

This is a vending machine application which you can feed money to and purchase items.

## How it works

### Main Menu

When you first open up the program, you are confronted with a main menu. From here you can either select to display the inventory of the machine, purchase an item, or exit the application.

Selecting '1' from the main menu will bring you to a menu that displays the code for the item, the name for the item, the price of the item and the type of said item.

Selecting '2' from the main menu will bring you to the purchase menu.

Selecting 'Q' from the main menu will exit the application.

### Purchase Menu

Navigating to the purchase menu will present you four different selections to either feed money into the machine, select a product to purchase, finish up the transaction or return to the main menu. It also displays your current balance in the machine.

Selecting '1' from the purchase menu will bring you to the feed money menu.

Selecting '2' from the purchase menu will bring you to the select product menu.

Selecting '3' from the purchase menu will bring you to the finish transaction menu.

Selecting 'B' from the purchase menu will return you to the main menu.

### Feed Money

Only allows you to feed in $1, $2, $5 and $10 dollar bills. Other bills or change will be rejected.

### Select Product

Allows you to enter a product code to select the item you wish to purchase. Inputting the product code of an item thats price is greater than your balance will ask for another product code i.e. you **MUST** purchase something. If you dont have atleast a dollar in the machine, you cannot access this menu.

### Finish Transaction

Spits out the remaining balance in coins and you can now consume your food items.
